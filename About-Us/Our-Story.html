					<p>We care about fantastic beer, our community, philanthropy, and making lifelong friends.  We are void of pretentiousness and arrogance.  At our core, we are "down home" good old boys with a splash of sophistication.  We are hard working, humble, nostalgic, and strive to provide our fellow beer drinkers with an unforgettable experience.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We are neither trust-funders, "independently wealthy", nor beneficiaries of a large inheritance from family members.  <span class="blueLetters">Our brewery is funded by large amounts of sweat</span>, as well as our retirement funds, children's college funds, a hefty bank loan, and two private equity investors (thank you; you know who you are).</p> 
					<br>   
					<p>We approach brewing as an organic relationship between the beer we make and the people who drink it.  Our beer is nothing without you.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Almost a decade ago, the idea of starting a brewery first emerged.  All three co-founders were manufacturing injectable medicines at the world's largest biotechnology company.  Under the tightest quality controls, we used some of the largest vessels and tanks in the industry.  Each workday was met with a passion for making what we made.  <span class="redLetters">We believed that our daily efforts made the world a better place.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p>It just so happens that there is another liquid on our planet that we believe makes the world a better place... beer.</p>  
					<br>
					<p>In 2012 serious business planning began for starting up a brewery.  Through many sleepless nights, meetings, and begging, we formed and funded Liquid Mechanics Brewing Co.  The name itself is a reflection of both the highly scientific  (fluid mechanics) and the artistic (brewing) expertise that goes into what we make.  <span class="blueLetters">Our logo is symbolic of the tenacious American work ethic that has made our nation what it is today</span>.  The gritty and "old timey" feel of the logo matches our personalities.  The colors on the ribbon resonate thoughts of vintage racing stripes, and harkens back to a bit of Americana that was fast, agile, and well built.  Additionally, the hot and cold colors are symbolic of the water temperatures needed to brew great beer.</p>
